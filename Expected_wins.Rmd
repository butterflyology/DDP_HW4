Major League Baseball is a sport that loves numbers and statistics. 

There is an amazingly simple association between the number of runs a team scores and the number of runs it allows. Bill James and other called this association the **Pythagorean expectation**.


$$W\% = \frac{R^{k}}{R^{k} + RA^{k}}$$

- *R* is the number of runs a team scores.
- *RA* is the number of runs a team allows.
- *k* is an exponant; 2 in our case. 
- *W%* is the winning percentage.

Multiply *W* by 162 and you get the number of expected wins. 

##

What is the correlation between the expected number of wins and the actual number of wins? The correlation is **0.97%**!!!

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
myteams <- Teams %>% 
  select(teamID, yearID, lgID, G, W, L, R, RA) %>% 
  mutate(RD = R - RA, Wpct = W / (W + L), pytWpct = R^2 / (R^2 + RA^2), pytResiduals = Wpct - pytWpct)

lm(myteams$pytWpct ~ myteams$Wpct)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(myteams, aes(y = pytWpct, x = Wpct)) + 
	theme_bw() +
	geom_point(cex = 2, alpha = 0.25) + 
	ylab("Pythagorean Win %") + 
	xlab("Win %") + 
	stat_smooth(method = "lm", color = "dodgerblue")
```

Let's run some code and see how it does:

The 2017 Los Angeles Dodgers scored 770 runs against 580 allowed.

```{r Pythag}
round((770^2 / (770^2 + 580^2)) * 162)
```

The *Pythagorean expectation* suggests that the Dodgers should win 103 runs in the 2017 season. 

They won 104.

I made a `shiny` app that is hosted on [`shinyapps.io`](https://butterflyology.shinyapps.io/pythagorean_expectation/). This app allows the user to provide a reasonable number of runs scored and allowed and then returns the number of expected wins. 

```{r image, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/App_screen_shot.png")
```
