## *Coursera* Developing Data Products Homework 4

#### This app has been deployed to [`shinyapps.io`](https://butterflyology.shinyapps.io/pythagorean_expectation/)

#### The slide deck lives [here](https://butterflyology.github.io/DDP_HW4/Expected_wins.html)

This is an app developed for the final project in the Developing Data Products *Coursera* module.

This `Shiny` app uses the Bill James' Pythagorean Formula and predicts the number of wins over a 162 games season given a user provided number of runs scored and runs allowed.

There are two sliders on the left side of the app:

- `Runs scored` - Slide the button to the number of runs the team scores.
- `Runs allowed` - Slide the button to the number of runs the team allowed.

On the right side of the app are three outputs:

- `Runs scored:` - The number of runs scored selected using the slider.
- `Runs allowed:` - The number of runs allowed selected using the slider.
- `Prediction:` - The predicted number of wins the team will have given the two inputs.
